# Automatic or custom permissions scaner for files and catalogs
Linux - Permissions scaner for files and catalogs


> [!NOTE]
> In Linux, proper use of chmod to manage file and directory permissions is critical for maintaining system security and integrity. Overly broad permissions (e.g., granting execute rights to "others" on sensitive scripts) can expose files to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion, creating security vulnerabilities. Excessive permissions may also compromise data confidentiality or system stability, as untrusted users could exploit lax settings to disrupt operations or gain unintended control.
